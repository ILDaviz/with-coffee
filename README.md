# With Coffee

Most of us drink buckets of coffee to develop a fucking simple app, but we don't credit coffee. Coffee has feelings too (Espresso has less, but still), let's credit coffee from now on in our apps.

By importing this module, it will show this message in console, only in production (It doesn't bug you while developing):

> Made with ☕️ coffee & 💝

## Install

```bash
npm install with-coffee
# or
yarn add with-coffee
```

Then import it in your project in which way you like.
